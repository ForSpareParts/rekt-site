Like most MOBAs, REKT is a game about degrading your fellow man through constant
verbal abuse.

Unlike most MOBAs, REKT actively rewards you for this behavior: the volume at
which you scream into your microphone increases your in-game power, boosting your
chances of winning and providing much-needed personal validation. Look at that
bar fill up every time you scream! Doesn't that feel good? Don't worry, your
teammates probably deserved it.

Rekt is designed by [Nathan Chamot](http://nate.chamotlabs.com) and programmed
by [David Jackson](http://forspareparts.github.io). They're very sorry.
