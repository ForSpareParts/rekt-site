...a [MOBA](http://leagueoflegends.com), where all your abilities are powered by screaming into your headset microphone.

REKT is intended for [Fuck This Jam](http://fuckthisjam.com/), a game jam where participants make a game in a genre they hate, or about an aspect of a genre they hate.  REKT is intended to lampoon the toxic community that plagues MOBA games.

REKT is currently under development.  We'll be posting our progress, videos, and development builds here.  If you'd like to watch our progress, please subscribe to our [RSS feed](/feed.xml), mailing list (in the sidebar), or follow [@thatfoxdude](https://twitter.com/thatfoxdude) on twitter.
